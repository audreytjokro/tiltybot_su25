# Interactive UX design Workshop
02 Feb 2024


### Motivation/目的
To share knowledge on how to build/prototype devices: Demonstrate and practice methods for studying interaction

### Overview/概要
This workshop is an introduction to design "listening robots" that can recognize sound cues and react appropriately in response. We will integrate interactive sound recognition capability into simple robots. You will build a basic robot to work with or you can bring your own robot.

### In the workshop, you will.../本ワークショップで行うこと
... design an interaction concept for a social robot that listens to its surroundings.
... learn how to collect datasets and use them for training Neural Nets for your chosen interaction concept.
... learn about mechanisms and motion design for expressiveness.

This workshop is set up as two Sunday sessions with two mid-week evening building and critique sessions.
